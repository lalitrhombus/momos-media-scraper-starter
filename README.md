## Multi containers pre-configured includes:

- Backend with Node, Express with nodemon for hot reload.
- Frontend created by create-react-app.
- PostgreSQL with credentials:
```sh
user: postgres
password: momos
```

## How to run:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

## Notes:
- This template is pretty much empty. It's just a baseline to help with overhead setups and get you right into coding as we acknowledge that your time is valuable.

- Don't be limited by this. Mandatory things are only Node and React. Postgres and Express are totally optional and feel free to change them as you feel it'll be more comfortable for you. (MySQL, Hapi,...)

- We'd prefer to get your submission on your personal Repository so don't forget to change the git configuration of the project.

## Good luck!
